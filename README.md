# Cryptopals
My solutions to the Cryptopals (from Matasano/NCC group) challenges, in golang
https://cryptopals.com/

I didn't write any Go before so these are my first Golang programms, I'm learning as I go (no pun intended)


Most files will compile with go run challengeX.go
If it doesn't compile that way, just look in the code, some challenges require previous ones, for example challenge 13 compiles with go run challenge13.go challenge11.go. Note that this means that you have to uncomment the main in challenge11.go if you want to run it. I need to fix it soon but my main focus for now is on having fun with the challenges
